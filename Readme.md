# Biodiversity National Parks Endangered Species Analysis
## Project Overview

#### This project involves analyzing data from the National Parks Service to understand the conservation status of various species across different national parks. The primary goal is to identify patterns or themes in the types of species that become endangered and to share insights based on the analysis.

## Objectives

#### Complete a data analysis project for your portfolio.
#### Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings.
#### Analyze and clean the provided datasets.
#### Create visualizations to illustrate key insights.
#### Pose and answer relevant questions regarding the data.

 ## Datasets
 
#### species_info.csv: Contains data about different species and their conservation status.
#### observations.csv: Contains recorded sightings of different species at several national parks over the past 7 days.

## Analysis Steps

#### Load the Data: Import the datasets using Pandas and examine the first few rows.
#### Data Cleaning and Exploration: Check for missing values and get summary statistics.
#### Visualize Conservation Status Distribution: Create a bar plot to show the distribution of conservation statuses.
#### Analyze Endangered Species by Category: Determine if certain types of species are more likely to be endangered.
#### Statistical Significance: Use the Chi-squared test to determine if the differences in conservation statuses among species categories are significant.
#### Identify Most Observed Species: Determine the most observed species in each park and visualize the results.
#### Conclusion: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

## Running the code 

#### Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

` pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy `

#### Open Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook in your project directory:

`jupyter notebook `

#### Load and Run the Notebook: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file `biodiversity.ipynb` and run the cells step by step to perform the analysis.
